Hello, I'm Gustavo N. Santiago!




Olá, eu sou o Gustavo Nocera Santiago!

I have a degree in Biosystems Engineering by University of Sao Paulo, at Brazil.
Because of this, most of my projects will be geared towards tools to aid engineering or related to agriculture,
such as process automation for image analysis linked to crops
or production of equipment and robots that will help producers and consultants.
However, nothing prevents me from carrying out projects other than artificial intelligence, other automation processes
or even linked to precision zootechnics.

I love learning and I'm here for it, I never stop learning and pursuing my goals.
When I draw an end, I cross seas and rivers to reach it.
